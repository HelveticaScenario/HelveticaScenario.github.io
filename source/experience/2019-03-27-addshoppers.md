I built the second version of the AddShoppers Dashboard, a campaign management portal for clients to create, edit, and review reporting metrics for ad campaigns run on their site through the AddShoppers Platform. Technologies used include React.js, Redux, Redux-Saga, GrapesJS, SASS, ImmutableJS, and PoiJS.
