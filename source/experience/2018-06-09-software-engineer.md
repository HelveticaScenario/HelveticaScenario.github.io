Part of the Monetization team, I built and maintained the web tools and interfaces to several of the companyâ€™s products. These included the internally used curation tools for both live stories and geofilters, as well as the public facing geofilter submission page at https://www.snapchat.com/geofilters. Technologies used include Backbone, jQuery, React/Flux, and Angular.
